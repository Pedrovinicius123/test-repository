An idea I've got

I'm higly suspecting that there is no algorithm that solves a 3-SAT (and forward) problem efficiently, most of the problems have a high time complexity in worst case.
But i have to prove that for *all* problems we have are contained in the worst case. There's a graph that determine it.
